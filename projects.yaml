# The Platform.sh integration uses the now deprecated "Service hooks", rather than webhooks. 
# The environment URL, and therefore the projectID, is not available on branches - only pull
# requests with the default integration settings. Until our integration is updated to provide
# P.sh environment information at least on the default branch, hardcoded projectIDs is necessary
# to test source operations. This file is not used where projectID is otherwise retrievable.
